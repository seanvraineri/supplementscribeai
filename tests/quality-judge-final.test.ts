1. USES SPECIFIC DATA:
   - Does it mention specific biomarker values (like "18 ng/mL" or "250 pg/mL")?
   - Does it use the person's actual name?
   - Does it reference specific age or symptoms?

2. IS PERSONALIZED:
   - Would this response ONLY work for one specific person?
   - Or could this be sent to anyone with "energy issues"?
   - Does it feel custom-written or template-based?

RESPOND IN THIS EXACT FORMAT:
USES_SPECIFIC_DATA: [YES/NO]
IS_PERSONALIZED: [YES/NO]
SCORE: [1-10]

Your Vitamin D level of 18 ng/mL is severely deficient, directly explaining your fatigue. At 28, you need 4000 IU daily to reach optimal levels.

Your B12 at 250 pg/mL is also suboptimal, contributing to your brain fog. Here's your personalized protocol:

1. Vitamin D3 4000 IU (morning) - Target your severe deficiency
2. Methylcobalamin B12 1000 mcg (morning) - Address your suboptimal levels
3. Iron Bisglycinate 25 mg (evening) - Support energy production
4. Magnesium Glycinate 400 mg (evening) - Improve your sleep quality
5. Ashwagandha 300 mg (evening) - Reduce stress affecting your energy
6. B-Complex (morning) - Support overall energy metabolism

Research shows vitamin D receptors in brain sleep centers become less responsive below 20 ng/mL - exactly where you are. Your B12 deficiency (250 pg/mL) compounds this since B12 is crucial for melatonin production.

For your specific situation: take D3 (4000 IU) in the morning to reset your circadian clock. You should see sleep improvements in 4-6 weeks as levels rise.
