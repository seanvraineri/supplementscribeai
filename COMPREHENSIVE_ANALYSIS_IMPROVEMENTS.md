- **Edge Functions**: Updated biomarker ranges to match health database exactly
- **Frontend**: Ensured data flow is consistent across all components

### 3. **Corrected Biomarker Ranges**
- **Vitamin D**: Fixed from 40-60 ng/mL to accurate 30-50 ng/mL (per health database)
- **Vitamin B12**: Corrected thresholds to match 300-900 pg/mL optimal range
- **Added CRP Analysis**: Complete inflammation marker analysis with accurate ranges
- **Added Homocysteine**: Cardiovascular risk marker with proper thresholds

### 4. **Enhanced UI Components**

#### Biomarker Cards
- **Header Section** (Always Visible):
  - Biomarker name with clean formatting
  - Status badge with color coding
  - Expand/collapse button
  - Current value and lab reference range
  - Quick status summary

- **Expandable Sections**:
  - **What It Does**: Educational content about the biomarker's function
  - **Potential Symptoms**: Health impacts when out of range
  - **Personalized Recommendations**: Specific, actionable advice
  - **Action Plan**: Clear next steps for optimization

#### SNP Cards
- **Header Section** (Always Visible):
  - Gene name and rsID
  - Genotype display
  - Risk level badge
  - Expand/collapse button
  - Quick genetic impact summary

- **Expandable Sections**:
  - **What This Gene Does**: Educational content about gene function
  - **Genetic Variant Effect**: Specific impact of the user's variant
  - **Personalized Recommendations**: Targeted interventions
  - **Action Plan**: Genetic-specific optimization strategies

### 5. **Visual Design Enhancements**
- **Color-Coded Status System**:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Optimal/Normal (emerald gradients)
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow/Orange: Attention needed (orange gradients)
  - ðŸ”´ Red: High risk/immediate action (red gradients)
  - ðŸ”µ Blue: Informational (blue gradients)

- **Premium Styling**:
  - Backdrop blur effects
  - Gradient backgrounds
  - Smooth animations
  - Professional typography
  - Consistent spacing and shadows

### 6. **Improved Information Architecture**
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Essential info first, details on demand
- **Consistent Layout**: Same structure for all cards
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Icons, headings, and content organization
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on all screen sizes

### 7. **Health-Critical Accuracy Measures**
- **Range Verification**: All ranges cross-referenced with health database
- **Database Synchronization**: Verified RLS policies and data flow
- **Edge Function Accuracy**: Updated analysis logic with correct thresholds
- **Frontend Consistency**: Ensured UI reflects accurate backend data

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
- âœ… `user_biomarkers` table with proper RLS policies
- âœ… `user_snps` table with supported_snps relationship
- âœ… `user_comprehensive_analysis` storage table
- âœ… All foreign key relationships properly configured

### Edge Functions
- âœ… `compute-comprehensive-analysis`: Generates accurate analysis
- âœ… `comprehensive-analysis`: Retrieves stored analysis

## Health Data Accuracy Verification

### Biomarker Ranges (Corrected)
- **Vitamin D**: 30-50 ng/mL optimal (was 40-60)
- **Vitamin B12**: 300-900 pg/mL optimal (corrected thresholds)
- **CRP**: <1.0 mg/L low risk, 1.0-3.0 moderate, >3.0 high risk
- **Homocysteine**: <8 Î¼mol/L optimal, 8-15 normal, >15 high risk
- **LDL Cholesterol**: <70 optimal, 70-99 good, 100-129 borderline, >130 high

### SNP Analysis (Verified)
- **MTHFR C677T**: Accurate folate metabolism impact assessment
- **COMT Val158Met**: Correct dopamine metabolism interpretation
- **All variants**: Proper genotype-specific recommendations

## User Experience Benefits

1. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Information presented progressively
2. **Better Decision Making**: Clear action plans and recommendations
3. **Educational Value**: "What it does" sections increase health literacy
4. **Mobile Friendly**: Collapsible design works well on small screens
5. **Professional Appearance**: Premium styling appropriate for $75/month service

## Quality Assurance
