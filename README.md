# SupplementScribe AI

**SupplementScribe** is an AI-driven personalized supplement recommendation platform designed to combat the risks of uncontrolled, "one-size-fits-all" supplement consumption. It provides safe, effective, and highly personalized supplement plans based on scientific evidence and individual biomarker data.

This project is built on the principle that supplement recommendations should be as precise as medical prescriptions, leveraging data from user intake questionnaires and optional genetic/blood test results to generate its insights.
